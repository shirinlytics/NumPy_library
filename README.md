 I completed another Python assignment centered around the utilization of the NumPy library, given by Atomcamp!

As we all know, NumPy is a powerful library used extensively in Machine learning and data science for efficient numerical computations. Through a plethora of excersises, I gained hands-on experience working with NumPy arrays and matrices for tasks like;
• Array creation using functions like np.array np.zeros, np.ones, np.flip and np.full_like etc, skill that comes handy while pre-processing of raw datasets.

• Array indexing using slicing functions, a skill that is critical for tasks like data exploration.

• Array manipulation using basic operators and astype() functions, a skill critical for data munging.
